# Zero to Hero Neural Networks

This directory contains implementations from following Andrej Karpathy's famous ["Neural Networks: Zero to Hero"](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) tutorial series, focused on building neural networks from scratch to understand the fundamentals of deep learning.

## Overview

These notebooks implement various neural network architectures for the task of character-level name generation, following Karpathy's approach of building from first principles.
